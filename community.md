# Yeti is Free and Open Source

And we intend to keep it that way. By opening Yeti, our goal is to turn it into a self-sustainable project, where not only the core developers but **the whole community** helps out when the community needs help. We believe that communication is better handled centrally and this is why we will be relying on **GitHub issues for all communication**. We will reconsider as the community grows.

If you want to help Yeti thrive and be the nice mystical creature it is destined to be, here are some tips.

### Developers

* Send [pull-requests](https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/pulls) our way!
* We understand Yeti's codebase is pretty massive, but if you have any questions on the inner workings of Yeti, feel free to open [issues](https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/issues); we will do our best to answer them promptly.

### Users

Even if you don't code, you can also help us by:

* Telling us how you're using Yeti, we can always think of new features to add when we see different use-cases.
* If you find something that doesn't work, tell the world by [opening an issue](https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/issues).
* When doing so, try to be as clear as possible and answer all the questions in the issue template.
